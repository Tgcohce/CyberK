# CyberK
CyberK is a very simple BAT script that helped me out during the cyberpatriot competition

# Only functionality at the moment is :

--> Disabling Guest and Admin accounts

--> Disabling RDP, remote desktop protocol

--> Was crucial for saving time in IT Security Competitions (Wasnt against the rules)

--> I would like to improve CyberK overtime

# Any contribution is the most welcomed
